## Little history about my self

After school i decided to become a civil engineer and a few years ago started to find my self unconfortable with my job, questioning about the life style i wanted to have. 
In the mid time, i moved from Argentina to Spain and settled in Barcelona where i had the opportunity to get into a fullstack bootcamp (for free!) and that was eventually, the best decision of my life. I mean that because i find my self deeply trapped about software development triggering a new passion in me.
